ABSTRACT
========
Finite automata have proven their usefulness in high-profile domains ranging
from network security to machine learning. While prior work focused on their
applicability for purely regular expression workloads such as antivirus and
network security rulesets, recent research has shown that automata can optimize
the performance for algorithms in other areas such as machine learning and even
particle physics.  Unfortunately, their emulation on traditional CPU
architectures is fundamentally slow and further bottlenecked by memory.  In this
paper, we present REAPR: Reconfigurable Engine for Automata PRocessing, a
flexible framework that synthesizes RTL for automata processing applications as
well as I/O to handle data transfer to and from the kernel. We show that even
with memory and control flow overheads, FPGAs still enable extremely
high-throughput computation of automata workloads compared to other
architectures.

INTRODUCTION
============ 
REAPR (Reconfigurable Engine for Automata Processing) is a tool developed by
researchers at the University of Virginia's Center for Automata Processing
(CAP), designed to accelerate automata processing applications using FPGA
boards. Specifically, this tool accelerates non-deterministic finite automata
(NFAs) by exploiting the similarities between the spatial distribution of
automaton states and transitions with the spatial distribution of FPGA circuit
resources. For more information, see our paper published in the proceedings of
the 2017 International Conference on Field Programmable Logic, Ghent, Belgium.
